This personal blog has been built by using Node.js and Express.js in the backend.

EJS templates and layouts has been used for multiple pages and data passing between front&back-end.

The new post you compose will be saved in an array & loaded on the homepage. 

Also, you can search posts by their title using "/posts/{postTitle}" route and the app will search
titles within the array of posts, and will redirect to individual post page.
